## Setup
- If you don't already have one, obtain an Open AI API key

- Add ``OPEN_AI_API_KEY`` to your environment
- ``echo 'export OPEN_AI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.bash_profile``
- If you are using a shell other than bash, such as zsh (common in newer macOS versions), 
replace .bash_profile with .zshrc or the appropriate configuration file for your shell.

3 - Install dependencies
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
